# TankGUN
PS3 controlled Tank with a Nurf gun on top
the Cannon file has the three action files as sub folders. These are dirived from 3action_nurf and what I got from Drone bot work shop. PS3 controller. 
the only file I have gotten to work is the 3action_nurf. that did work at one time and then I fried the UNOR3 it was attached to.
